# What am i used ?
  - Tensorflow
    - Transfer Learning(to get high accuracy, performance with pre-trained models - Mobilenet V2): tensorflow has perfect documentation about it.
  - OpenCV
    - To create user interface
    - To handle input preprocessing.
  - Arduino (to on/off lights via serial communication - You can also handle this on RPi).
